## Hey, I'm Evict!
> I'm a **self-taught programmer**, **privacy advocate**, and **project enjoyer**. :tada:

Some programming languages I've used over the years are:
- *[Python3](https://python.org/)* - Mostly used for quick and effective testing. I mostly use it for creating quick projects with [TLS Client](https://pypi.org/project/tls-client).
- *[Go(lang)](https://go.dev/)* - I love Go, it's fast and easily deployable on the go. I common use the [go-prompt](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/c-bata/go-prompt) package.
- *[Java](https://www.oracle.com/java)* - I've used it for making Minecraft modifications. Although, I'd like to learn [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) more.
- *[Luau](https://luau-lang.org/)* - I used to code in it for ROBLOX development until Wine ([Vinegar](https://github.com/vinegarhq/vinegar)) was blocked entirely.
- Some other languages I've played with: *[C++](https://isocpp.org/)*, *[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)*, *[Zig](https://ziglang.org/)*, *[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)*, and so many more.

Some things I'd like to accomplish in 2024 are:
- [ ] Regain strength in my arms.
- [x] Run 3 miles without break.
- [ ] Learn how to make an Operating System.
- [ ] Make a completely independent Email service.
